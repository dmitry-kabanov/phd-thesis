Reactive Euler equations with two-step chemistry

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we extend our work in Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:e1d"

\end_inset

 by applying the developed method for linear stability analysis to the detonatio
n model based on the reactive Euler equations with two-step reaction mechanism.
 The two-step model that we consider here consists of two consecutive reactions:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{A}\overset{}{\to}\text{B}\overset{}{\to}\text{C},\label{eq:e1deig:reactions}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the first reaction is exothermic and the second endothermic, and again
 we assume that specific heats are the same for all species and there is
 no mole change in the mixture such that all species have the same molar
 mass, and hence, gas constants.
 The reader might think that this model is a simple extension of the one-step
 model of Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:e1d"

\end_inset

 by adding an extra reaction, and would be right to think so if both reactions
 were exothermic.
 However, endothermicity in this model leads to qualitative changes of travellin
g-wave solutions comparing to the solutions of the one-step model, as their
 existence is determined by the presence of the 
\emph on
embedded
\emph default
 sonic point inside the reaction zone (in contrast with the one-step model,
 where the sonic point is at the end of the reaction zone).
 The zone between the shock and the sonic point is determined uniquely,
 however, the flow between the sonic point and the equilibrium point is
 not and it can be subsonic or supersonic, that is, steady reaction zone
 is not actually steady.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Detonation of Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:e1d"

\end_inset

, is called equilibrium detonation (or CJ detonation) because the steady
 detonation velocity is determined through algebraic relations at the point
 of chemical equilibrium by the condition of the sonicity at that point
 and thus, it does not depend on the reaction rate but only on the overall
 heat release, which is maximum heat release due to the irreversible exothermic
 reaction.
 In contrast, the model considered in this chapter is often referred to
 as the case of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pathological
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 detonation or 
\emph on
eigenvalue
\emph default
 detonation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "FickettDavis2000"

\end_inset

.
 It is quite different from the equilibrium detonation in a sense that the
 steady detonation velocity is determined by the reaction rates of both
 reactions and the maximum heat release obtained at the sonic point, that
 is, detonation velocity is an eigenvalue of a boundary-value problem for
 a system of ordinary differential equations with boundary conditions determined
 by the Rankineâ€“Hugoniot conditions and the sonic-point conditions.
 The term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pathological detonation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (for a different model but with the same features) was coined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Neumann1942"

\end_inset

 and is based on the expectation that the detonation velocity is determined
 by the equilibrium heat release 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\text{e}}$
\end_inset

, while it is actually determined by the maximum heat release 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\text{max}}$
\end_inset

 at the sonic point, hence, observed detonation velocity is larger than
 expected as 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\text{e}}<Q_{\text{max}}$
\end_inset

 due to endothermicity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the embedded sonic point, normal-mode analysis of this model is quite
 intricate
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Sharpe1999"

\end_inset

 as it relies on the asymptotic expansions in the neighborhood of the sonic
 point to obtain the initial values for the integration with the shooting
 method towards the shock and towards the end of the reaction zone from
 the sonic point.
 Presence of the embedded sonic point, thus, makes normal-mode analysis
 difficult for this model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, our aim in this chapter is to apply the method to this model and investigate
 how the method performs when the base steady state contains an embedded
 sonic point.
 We investigate both types of the ZND solutions (subsonic-subsonic and subsonic-
supersonic) possible for this model and compare our results qualitatively
 to the results of
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Sharpe1999"

\end_inset

 for the subsonic-supersonic case.
 We also check the hypothesis that the stability properties are determined
 only by the region between the sonic point and the shock, albeit this analysis
 is challenging numerically as the subsonic-subsonic steady-state solutions
 are continuous but not differentiable at the sonic point, which leads to
 the linear hyperbolic system with discontinuous coefficients, hence, the
 perturbations develop discontinuities as well and fine grid resolution
 is required for the simulations.
 In spite of these difficulties, we find that our method is capable to handle
 linear stability analysis of this model without any special treatment of
 the sonic point.
 Application of this method to this model is an important step in the assessment
 of the performance of the method for the detonation models with large kinetic
 mechanisms with possible nonmonotonic distribution of heat release in the
 reaction zone.

Governing equations

\begin_layout Standard
Let the reactions
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 have rate constants 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{2}$
\end_inset

, heat releases 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}<0$
\end_inset

, and activation energies, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{2}$
\end_inset

, for the first (
\begin_inset Formula $\text{A}\to\text{B}$
\end_inset

), and second, (
\begin_inset Formula $\text{B}\to\text{C}$
\end_inset

), reactions, respectively.
 Then, if 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\text{A}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\text{B}}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\text{C}}$
\end_inset

 denote the mass fractions of the species, the kinetic equations for the
 reactions follow the Arrhenius law: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\od{X_{\text{A}}}t & =-k_{1}X_{\text{A}}\exp\left(-\frac{E_{1}}{RT}\right),\\
\od{X_{\text{B}}}t & =\phantom{-}k_{1}X_{\text{A}}\exp\left(-\frac{E_{1}}{RT}\right)-k_{2}X_{\text{B}}\exp\left(-\frac{E_{2}}{RT}\right),\\
\od{X_{\text{C}}}t & =\phantom{-}k_{2}X_{\text{B}}\exp\left(-\frac{E_{2}}{RT}\right),
\end{align}

\end_inset

describing evolution of the mass fractions of the species in the absence
 of flow.
 Obviously, sum of the mass fractions is unity: 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{A}+X_{B}+X_{C}=1$
\end_inset

 with initial mass fractions being 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\text{A}}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{\text{B}}=X_{\text{C}}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of considering three equations for each species, we introduce the
 reaction progress variables for each reaction as 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=1-X_{\text{A}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=X_{\text{C}}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

 varying from zero at the shock to unity at the end of the reaction zone
 with the reaction rates
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega_{1}=k_{1}\left(1-\lambda_{1}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{E_{1}}{RT}\right),\quad\omega_{2}=k_{2}\left(\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{E_{2}}{RT}\right).\label{eq:e1deig:reaction-rates}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the full system of the governing equations in the shock-attached frame
 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\rho_{t}+\left(\rho\left(u-D\right)\right)_{x} & =0,\label{eq:e1deig:mass}\\
\left(\rho u\right)_{t}+\left(\rho u\left(u-D\right)+p\right)_{x} & =0,\nonumber \\
\left(\rho e\right)_{t}+\left(\rho\left(u-D\right)e+pu\right)_{x} & =0,\nonumber \\
\left(\rho\lambda_{1}\right)_{t}+\left(\rho(u-D)\lambda_{1}\right)_{x} & =\rho\omega_{1},\nonumber \\
\left(\rho\lambda_{2}\right)_{t}+\left(\rho(u-D)\lambda_{2}\right)_{x} & =\rho\omega_{2},\label{eq:e1deig:reaction-2}
\end{align}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $e=e_{\text{i}}+u^{2}/2$
\end_inset

 being the specific total energy, and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{i}=pv/\left(\gamma-1\right)-\left(Q_{1}\lambda_{1}+Q_{2}\lambda_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 being the specific internal energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $v=1/\rho$
\end_inset

 being the specific volume.

) which leads to the differential-algebraic system
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\rhoZnd\UZnd & =-\rhoA\DZnd,\label{eq:e1deig:znd-mass}\\
\pZnd+\rhoZnd\UZnd^{2} & =\pA+\rhoA\DZnd^{2},\nonumber \\
\eZnd+\pZnd\vZnd+\frac{\UZnd^{2}}{2} & =\eA+\pA\vA+\frac{\DZnd^{2}}{2},\nonumber \\
\od{\bar{\lambda}_{1}}x & =\frac{\bar{\omega}_{1}}{\UZnd}=\frac{k_{1}(1-\lambdaZnd_{1})\exp\left(-\rhoZnd E_{1}/\pZnd\right)}{\UZnd},\label{eq:e1deig:znd-reaction-1}\\
\od{\lambdaZnd_{2}}x & =\frac{\bar{\omega}_{2}}{\UZnd}=\frac{k_{2}(\lambdaZnd_{1}-\lambdaZnd_{2})\exp\left(-\rhoZnd E_{2}/\pZnd\right)}{\UZnd}\label{eq:e1deig:znd-reaction-2}
\end{align}

\end_inset

with constant detonation velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{D}$
\end_inset

 being the parameter to be determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We introduce 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{M}=-\rhoA\DZnd$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{P}=\pA+\rhoA\DZnd^{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{H}=\eA+\pA\vA+\DZnd^{2}/2$
\end_inset

 and express 
\begin_inset Formula $\UZnd$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pZnd$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vZnd$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\UZnd=\bar{M}\vZnd,\quad\pZnd=\bar{P}-\bar{M}^{2}\vZnd,
\]

\end_inset

and arrive at the quadratic equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\vZnd$
\end_inset

 with the root
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vZnd=\frac{\gamma}{\gamma+1}\frac{\bar{P}}{\bar{M}^{2}}(1-\delta),
\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta=\pm\sqrt{1-\frac{h\bar{M}^{2}}{\bar{P}^{2}}\left(\bar{H}+\bar{Q}\right)},\quad h=\frac{2(\gamma^{2}-1)}{\gamma^{2}},\quad\bar{Q}=Q_{1}\lambdaZnd_{1}+Q_{2}\lambdaZnd_{2}.\label{eq:e1deig:delta}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, it can be shown 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KasimovStewart2005"

\end_inset

 that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta^{2}=\left(\frac{1-\MachZnd^{2}}{1+\gamma\MachZnd^{2}}\right)^{2},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\MachZnd=\UZnd/\cZnd$
\end_inset

 is the Mach number of the steady-state flow.
 Hence the sign of the square root in the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is determined by whether the flow is subsonic or supersonic.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0$
\end_inset

 when the flow is sonic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regularity condition for the ZND solution to be continuous is determined
 by the boundedness of the derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

, hence
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\od{\delta}x=\mp\frac{h\bar{M}^{2}}{\bar{P}^{2}\delta}\od Qx\text{ is finite}
\]

\end_inset

when at the sonic point maximum heat release is obtained:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta^{*}=0\text{ and \od{Q^{*}}x=0}\label{eq:e1deig:sonicity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

for some 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}$
\end_inset

 being the location of the sonic point.
 From the second of conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 it follows using Eq.

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta^{*}=0\text{ and }Q_{1}\bar{\omega}_{1}^{*}+Q_{2}\bar{\omega}_{2}^{*}=0,\label{eq:e1deig:sonicity-2}

\end_inset

which is known as generalized Chapmanâ€“Jouguet condition
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Kirkwood1954"

\end_inset

, that is, the detonation velocity is determined by the conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 and generally calculated as follows

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 For a guess 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{D}$
\end_inset

, one solves steady reaction equations from the shock to the sonic point,
 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 For arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{D}$
\end_inset

, conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 will not be satisfied, and instead the steady-state solution will blow
 up.
 But for special 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{D}$
\end_inset

, the solution will pass continuously (however, not necessarily smoothly)
 through 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}$
\end_inset

 to the equilibrium state at 
\begin_inset Formula $x\to-\infty$
\end_inset

, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{D}$
\end_inset

 is computed by shooting and determines the solution of the boundary-value
 problem for system (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) with shock conditions and conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 at the boundaries, hence the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

eigenvalue detonation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for this model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
General numerical procedure outlined above can be followed to determine
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{D}$
\end_inset

.
 We, however, restrict our attention in this work to the case 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{1}=E_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}=k_{2}$
\end_inset

, for which equations simplify and detonation velocity can be found analytically.
 Considering only the reaction equations (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:e1deig:znd-reaction-1"

\end_inset

â€“
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:e1deig:znd-reaction-2"

\end_inset

) and dividing the second-reaction equation by the first-reaction equation,
 we arrive at
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\od{\lambdaZnd_{2}}{\lambdaZnd_{1}}=\frac{\lambdaZnd_{1}-\lambdaZnd_{2}}{1-\lambdaZnd_{1}},
\]

\end_inset

which is solved as follows: denoting 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=\lambdaZnd_{2}-\lambdaZnd_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=\lambdaZnd_{1}$
\end_inset

 we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\od{\lambdaZnd_{2}}{\lambdaZnd_{1}}=\od{\left(\xi+\psi\right)}{\xi}=1+\od{\psi}{\xi}=\frac{-\psi}{1-\xi},
\]

\end_inset

which gives linear ODE of the first order for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi:$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\od{\psi}{\xi}+\frac{\psi}{1-\xi}+1=0
\]

\end_inset

with the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=\left(1-\xi\right)\,\ln\left(1-\xi\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Transforming variables back, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lambdaZnd_{2}=\lambdaZnd_{1}+(1-\lambdaZnd_{1})\,\ln\left(1-\lambdaZnd_{1}\right),\label{eq:e1deig:lambda_2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambdaZnd_{2}\leq\lambdaZnd_{1}$
\end_inset

 (natural logarithm yields negative values when 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq\lambdaZnd_{1}\leq1$
\end_inset

) with equality holding only for 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambdaZnd_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambdaZnd_{1}=1$
\end_inset

.
 This observation has the following consequence: both 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambdaZnd_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambdaZnd_{2}$
\end_inset

 monotonically increase towards the ends of the reaction zone, which follows
 from the reaction rate expressions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:e1deig:reaction-rates"

\end_inset

 evaluate for the steady state.
 Hence, equilibrium heat release 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\text{e}}=Q_{1}+Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 is not a maximum value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 in the reaction zone, which is illustrated on Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:e1deig:znd-solution-Q-vs-lambda1"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now having the relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\lambda}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\lambda}_{1}$
\end_inset

, we substitute them into 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:e1deig:sonicity-2"

\end_inset

 to obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q_{1}(1-\lambdaZnd_{1}^{*})-Q_{2}(1-\lambdaZnd_{1}^{*})\,\ln\left(1-\lambdaZnd_{1}^{*}\right)=0,
\]

\end_inset

so either 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambdaZnd_{1}^{*}=1$
\end_inset

 (which leads to equilibrium solution as for one-step model of Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:e1d"

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambdaZnd_{1}^{*}=1-\exp\left(Q_{1}/Q_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Both of these cases are considered below.

\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0$
\end_inset

 for this case will be imaginary due to the negativity of the square-root
 expression for

 Therefore, equilibrium solutions are impossible for this model.

 The flow is divided then by the sonic point into two parts.
 Between the shock and the sonic point, the flow is always subsonic relative

 Between the sonic point and equilibrium point, the flow can be either subsonic

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model with two reactions represents an example of complex chemistry
 that brings in the following additional complications that are absent in
 the one-step model.
 First, we now have two traveling-wave solutions for the same set of parameters
 of the problem, and therefore we must investigate the stability of both.
 Second, the solution has an embedded sonic point, that is the sonic condition
 is reached at a finite distance from the lead shock.
 This divides the post-shock flow into two regions that play distinct roles
 in the detonation dynamics.
 Following prior research on the role of sonic points in unsteady detonation
 dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "KasimovStewart2004,StewartKasimov2005"

\end_inset

, we expect that the dynamics is affected only by the solution between the
 shock and the sonic point.
 How exactly this idea plays out in the linear stability calculations is
 not obvious, and this will be explored in this section.

\begin_layout Subsection
ZND and perturbation solutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the model has several additional parameters coming from the more complex
 chemistry.
 Comprehensive investigation of the entire parameter space would be a difficult
 task.
 Instead, we focus here on particular questions that have certain physical
 interest.
 Namely, we investigate how the level of endothermicity affects stability,
 and in addition, we compare stability behavior of the two steady-state
 solutions that co-exist at the same parameter set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we study the behavior of ZND solutions when 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}$

 is varied while all other parameters are kept fixed.

 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the perturbations for the subsonic-supersonic case, while Figure
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-pert-sub-sub"

\end_inset

 for the subsonic-subsonic case.
 The most prominent distinction between the two figures is that, while profiles
 for the subsonic-supersonic case are smooth, profiles for the subsonic-subsonic
 case develop discontinuities at the sonic point caused by discontinuous
 coefficient matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:numalg:gov"

\end_inset

: ZND profiles themselves are continuous, their derivatives with respect
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 have jump discontinuities at the sonic point, hence, discontinuous perturbation
s.
 In addition, we noticed that the upwind method (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:numal:upwind5-left"

\end_inset

â€“
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:numalg:upwind5-right"

\end_inset

) with Laxâ€“Friedrichs flux led to severe Gibbs oscillations on both sides
 of the jump in the profiles of the subsonic-subsonic case.
 For this reason, we replaced the upwind method with the WENO method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "JiangPeng2000"

\end_inset

 for all simulations based on subsonic-subsonic case.
 Another important observation from comparing figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-pert"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-pert-sub-sub"

\end_inset

 is that perturbations are nearly the same in the region between the sonic
 point and the leading detonation shock: for example, the relative difference
 between density perturbations is only 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 in this region, and it is likely caused by the smearing of the discontinuities
 in the neighborhood of the sonic point.

Migration of spectra with increasing endothermicity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we investigate how the stability behavior changes as the endothermicity
 increases, that is as 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 increases in magnitude while all the other parameters are kept fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, consider the subsonic-supersonic case.
 We choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\Nhrz=40$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1.2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E=25$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}=50$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 vary in the range 
\begin_inset Formula $-45\le Q_{2}\le0$
\end_inset

 with step 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Q_{2}=0.0025$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}\in[-0.7;-0.8]\cup[-13.9;-14]\cup[-19.9;-20]\cup[-25.2;-25.3]$
\end_inset

 and step 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Q_{2}=0.1$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-migration-sub-super"

\end_inset

 shows how growth rates change as 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 decreases.
 Initially, at 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}=0$
\end_inset

 detonation corresponds to the equilibrium CJ case and is stable for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}$
\end_inset

 that we use (critical value of activation energy is 
\begin_inset Formula $25.26$
\end_inset

).
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 decreases, the growth rate of the fundamental mode (mode 0) increases almost
 linearly such that at 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}\approx-0.79$
\end_inset

 detonation becomes unstable, and at 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}\approx-25.2225$
\end_inset

 mode 0 splits into two purely exponential branches, with growth rates increasin
g and decreasing for the top and bottom branches, respectively.
 At the same time at 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}\approx-13.1$
\end_inset

 the stable mode 1 appears in the spectrum, which becomes unstable at 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}\approx-13.9425$
\end_inset

.
 As the growth rate of this mode increases faster than that of mode 0, at
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}\approx-19.92$
\end_inset

 it becomes the dominant mode and remains so all the way down to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}=-45$
\end_inset

.
 In total, up to six modes appear in the spectrum as 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}\to-45$
\end_inset

.
 Here we point out that taking 
\begin_inset Formula $|Q_{2}|$
\end_inset

 larger than 45 makes computations prohibitively expensive as the effective
 reaction lengths become hundreds of thousands of nondimensional units,
 because as 
\begin_inset Formula $|Q_{2}|\to|Q_{1}|$
\end_inset

 the overall heat release becomes effectively zero and detonation degenerates
 to an inert weak shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, consider the subsonic-subsonic case.
 The physical parameters are taken the same as in the previous case.
 However, due to the discontinuous coefficients in the linearized system
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:numalg:gov"

\end_inset

, now we must use drastically higher resolutions (here 
\begin_inset Formula $\Nhrz=1280$
\end_inset

) than for the subsonic-supersonic case.
 Otherwise, we are unable to extract low-energy modes.
 We also emphasize that it is significantly more difficult to postprocess
 the time series of perturbation of detonation velocity for the subsonic-subsoni
c case.
 The reason is that the time series contains substantial amount of numerical
 noise caused by the numerical smearing of the jump in the solution in the
 neighborhood of the sonic locus.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-re-alpha-vs-q_2-together"

\end_inset

 shows the spectra for subsonic-supersonic and subsonic-subsonic cases together.
 It can be seen that the spectra are close to each other.
 In fact, they are essentially indistinguishable for oscillatory part of
 mode 0, upper branch of exponential part of mode 0, and for modes 1, 2,
 and 3.
 However, for subsonic-subsonic case, the lower branch of exponential part
 of mode 0 shows significant numerical noise as 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 decreases.
 The same behavior is seen with mode 4 as well.
 The reason for this is that the discontinuity in the solutions for subsonic-sub
sonic case generates noise that contaminates time series of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi'$
\end_inset

.
 As the lower branches of modes 0 and 4 contribute to the time series much
 less energy than other modes, they are more difficult to distinguish from
 the noise, which is an issue that can probably be fixed by using an improved
 algorithm for solving hyperbolic problems with discontinuous coefficients.
 Nevertheless, the computed values are near their counterparts for the subsonic-
supersonic case.
 Despite some differences in the spectra, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-re-alpha-vs-q_2-together"

\end_inset

 serves as a demonstration that stability of ZND solutions of the two-step
 model with endothermicity does not depend on whether the underlying ZND
 solution is of subsonic-supersonic or subsonic-subsonic case.
 That is, the detonation stability is apparently determined solely by the
 dynamics of the reaction zone between the sonic point and the leading detonatio
n shock.

As a final note on this section, we give the reader an idea of the computational
 requirements for these calculations.
 For both subsonic-supersonic and subsonic-subsonic cases, the number of

 we took is approximately 500.
 Then, as the resolution necessary for the subsonic-supersonic case is only
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Nhrz=40$
\end_inset

, we were able to compute Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-migration-sub-super"

\end_inset

 overnight on a workstation with 16 cores.
 In contrast, the subsonic-subsonic case requires much higher resolution
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Nhrz=1280$
\end_inset

, so these computations required a day with 512 parallel workers on a parallel
 computer, where a worker simulates and postprocesses results for a given
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 independently of other workers.

\begin_layout Subsection
Neutral stability curve
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we study how endothermicity affects the neutral stability
 boundary in comparison with the one-step model.
 The comparison is based on the idea that the detonation dynamics in both
 cases is determined by the energy released between the shock and sonic
 point.
 Therefore, the one-step model with heat release 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is compared with the two-step model with the maximum heat release 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{*}$
\end_inset

 equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-neutral-curve"

\end_inset

, we show the neutral stability curves in the parametric plane 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

â€“
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 We use 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1.2$
\end_inset

 and therefore the neutral stability curve for the one-step model is the
 same as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:LS-comparison"

\end_inset

.
 The neutral curve for the two-step model is obtained for the ZND solution
 corresponding to the subsonic-supersonic case.
 The range of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-0.35}$
\end_inset

â€“
\begin_inset Formula $10^{2.35}$
\end_inset

 with 256 logspaced points while 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}$
\end_inset

 is varied in proportion to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{2}=-0.75Q_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 For each 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{1}$
\end_inset

 we find the critical value of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 by the algorithm described earlier.
 For values of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-0.35}\le Q_{1}\lessapprox0.8$
\end_inset

 (approximately 20 points) the algorithm did not converge and we omit these
 values from the figure.
 The curves shown demonstrate that endothermicity consistently shifts the
 neutral stability boundary toward smaller values of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 over the whole range of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 that we investigated.
 The difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E$
\end_inset

 between critical activation energies for two models behaves with varying
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 as follows.
 The minimum value 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E\approx1.5$
\end_inset

 is attained for 
\begin_inset Formula $5\lessapprox Q\lessapprox15$
\end_inset

.
 As 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 increases, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E$
\end_inset

 increases monotonically and reaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E\approx4.5$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\to100$
\end_inset

.
 For low values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E$
\end_inset

 increases quickly and in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\to0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta E\to\infty$
\end_inset

 as the detonation wave becomes an inert shock.
 Additionally, while for the one-step model, all ZND solutions are stable
 at 
\begin_inset Formula $E\leq14.2$
\end_inset

 for the full considered range of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, for the two-reaction model all ZND solutions are stable for 
\begin_inset Formula $E\leq12.6$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, the two-step exothermic-endothermic heat release leads to an increased
 instability compared to the equivalent one-step heat release.
 In order to provide some qualitative explanation for this observation,
 we look at how the steady-state thermicity behaves for the same values
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{*}$
\end_inset

 for the two models.
 The thermicity for the two-step model is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\sigma}_{1}\bar{\omega}_{1}+\bar{\sigma}_{2}\bar{\omega}_{2}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\sigma}_{i}=(\gamma-1)Q_{i}/\bar{c}^{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2$
\end_inset

.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-themicity"

\end_inset

 shows the thermicity profiles for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1.2$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{*}=10$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $E=15$
\end_inset

 which correspond to the unstable steady-state solutions from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:eigval-neutral-curve"

\end_inset

.
 It is clear that for the two-step model the thermicity has significantly
 larger peak value which is in addition located closer to the lead shock
 than the value for the one-step model.
 Thus, a possible reason for the increased instability is this sharper profile
 of the thermicity function that makes for a more effective resonant cavity
 for the perturbations between the shock and the sonic point.
 Recall that the thermicity is a source term in the equation for the forward
 characteristics, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{p}+\rho c\dot{u}=\rho c^{2}\left(\sigma_{1}\omega_{1}+\sigma_{2}\omega_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 As such it could be looked at as a measure of how the chemical reactions
 amplify the forward compression waves that influence the lead shock.
 The larger the magnitude of thermicity, the stronger the effect.
 The sharpness of the thermicity function reflects in the sensitivity of
 this influence on the changes in the local state in the reaction zone,
 the stronger sensitivity implying more instability.
 This is a qualitative arguments explaining the shift of the stability boundary.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we applied the method developed in this work for linear
 stability analysis to the detonation model based on the reactive Euler
 equations with two-step kinetic mechanism with one reaction being endothermic
 which gives rise to the equilibrium detonations with embedded sonic point.
 We demonstrated that the method is capable of analysis of this model without
 any special treatment for the sonic point, although numerical solution
 of the linear unsteady problem for this model is challenging when the underlyin
g base steady-state solution is of subsonic-subsonic type as the linearized
 system has discontinuous solutions in this case, hence, fine grid resolution
 is required for the extraction of stability information from the perturbations
 of detonation velocity.
 We also compared migration of linear spectrum when endothermicity is varied
 and found that the both steady-state solution possess the same spectrum
 with minor differences in less energetic modes due to the numerical noise
 generated around the discontinuity in the solution.
 Nevertheless, we demonstrated that the linear spectrum (and hence detonation
 dynamics) is determined by the region of the reaction zone between the
 sonic point and the shock, at least in the linear case.
