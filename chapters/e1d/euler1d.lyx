\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we consider linear stability of a detonation model which
 is based on the one-dimensional reactive Euler equations for a perfect
 gas that has a constant ratio of specific heats and undergoes single first-orde
r irreversible monomolecular reaction
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\text{reactant}\to\text{product}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

such that the molar masses of both species are the same.
 This model is ubiquitously used in the research on stability of detonations
 beginning with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Erpenbeck1964"

\end_inset

 due to its relative simplicity and was studied extensively using normal-mode
 approach (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "LeeStewart1990,ShortStewart1998,Sharpe1997"

\end_inset

) for its linear stability properties.
 However, one should be aware that despite of the simplicity of the model,
 its analysis via normal modes is complicated: postulation of the normal-mode
 solution of the governing equations linearized about a base steady-state
 solution leads to the two-point boundary-value problem for a system of
 ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with one boundary at the shock state
 and the other boundary in the equilibrium state at the end of the reaction
 zone, in which the system of ODEs becomes singular.
 Besides, due to the first-order of the reaction, the reaction zone length
 is infinite, such that one has to truncate the computational domain at
 some point and formulate an approximate boundary condition at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

practical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 end of the reaction zone, which demands that perturbations are bounded
 (boundedness condition).
 After that one has to integrate the system numerically as it is with variable
 coefficients due to the nonconstant base steady state and obtain the eigenvalue
s of the problem (stability spectra) with positive real parts indicating
 the growth of the amplitude of the perturbations with time and hence, instabili
ty.
 Finding eigenvalues is done using shooting method
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "PressEtAl2007"

\end_inset

 and there are two options here: start at the shock and integrate towards
 chemical-equilibrium boundary ensuring that the boundedness condition is
 satisfied (an approach taken by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "LeeStewart1990,ShortStewart1998"

\end_inset

) or start at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

practical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 equilibrium boundary using asymptotic expansions to obtain the approximate
 values of state variables as an initial condition for the shooting method
 and integrate towards the shock (approach used by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Sharpe1997"

\end_inset

) ensuring that the Rankineâ€“Hugoniot conditions are satisfied at the shock.
 Both approaches are complicated in a sense that they require a special
 treatment of the singularity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our aim here to develop a new method of linear stability analysis and apply
 it to this model.
 The method avoids dealing with singularity as the linearized equations
 for perturbations are unsteady and nonsingular.
 We fully explain in this chapter the method including the formulation of
 the governing equations in the shock-attached frame, formulation of the
 linear unsteady problem, numerical methods used to solve it, and the method
 of postprocessing via dynamic mode decomposition
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Schmid2010"

\end_inset

 the results of computations to extract stability spectra, namely, growth
 rates and frequencies (stability spectra) of the linear perturbations,
 which are solutions of the linear unsteady problem.
 Particularly, we show that the time series of the perturbation of detonation
 velocity are enough to extract stability spectra without the need to postproces
s the full solution of the linear unsteady problem.
 Numerous stability results obtained by other researchers using normal-mode
 approach allow us to verify the method.

\begin_layout Standard
The one-dimensional reactive Euler equations for this system with one-step
 chemistry are the usual laws of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy,
 augmented with the balance law for the reaction progress variable:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\rho_{t}+\left(\rho u\right)_{x} & =0,\label{eq:e1d:mass-1}\\
\left(\rho u\right)_{t}+\left(\rho u^{2}+p\right)_{x} & =0,\label{eq:e1d:momentum-1}\\
\left(\rho e\right)_{t}+\left(\rho ue+pu\right)_{x} & =0,\label{eq:e1d:energy-1}\\
\left(\rho\lambda\right)_{t}+\left(\rho u\lambda\right)_{x} & =\rho\omega,\label{eq:e1d:reaction-1}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 are density, flow velocity, pressure, total specific energy, reaction progress
 variable, and reaction rate, respectively.
 Reaction progress variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is defined such that the mass fraction of the reactant is 
\begin_inset Formula $1-\lambda$
\end_inset

 and that of the product is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 (hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 varies from zero in nonreacted state to unity in the fully reacted state).
 The specific total energy is 
\begin_inset Formula $e=e_{\text{i}}+u^{2}/2$
\end_inset

 with constitutive relations of a calorically perfect gas: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e_{\text{i}}=\frac{pv}{\gamma-1}-Q\lambda,\qquad pv=RT,\label{eq:e1d:e_i}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\text{i}}$
\end_inset

 is specific internal energy, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 the ratio of specific heats, 
\begin_inset Formula $v=1/\rho$
\end_inset

 specific volume, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 chemical heat release, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 gas constant, 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 temperature.
 The reaction rate is taken here to follow simple-depletion first-order
 Arrhenius law: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega=k\left(1-\lambda\right)\exp\left(-\frac{E\rho}{p}\right),\label{eq:e1d:Arrhenius}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the rate constant and 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 the activation energy.

To transform Eq.

) to the shock-attached frame, we assume that in the laboratory reference
 frame detonation wave moves from left to right with detonation speed 
\begin_inset Formula $D=D(t^{\ell})>0$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{\ell}$
\end_inset

 is time, from initial position 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}^{\ell}=0$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}^{\ell}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Then the transformation to the shock-attached frame is defined by equations
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
x & =x^{\ell}-x_{\mathrm{s}}^{\ell}=x^{\ell}-\int_{0}^{t^{\ell}}D(\tau)\,d\tau,\\
t & =t^{\ell},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

such that position of the shock in the shock-attached frame is 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{\mathrm{s}}=0$
\end_inset

 for any time 
\begin_inset Formula $t\geq0$
\end_inset

.
 Then the governing equations in the shock-attached frame are
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
\rho_{t}+\left(\rho\left(u-D\right)\right)_{x} & =0,\label{eq:e1d:mass}\\
\left(\rho u\right)_{t}+\left(\rho u\left(u-D\right)+p\right)_{x} & =0,\label{eq:e1d:momentum}\\
\left(\rho e\right)_{t}+\left(\rho\left(u-D\right)e+pu\right)_{x} & =0,\label{eq:e1d:energy}\\
\left(\rho\lambda\right)_{t}+\left(\rho\left(u-D\right)\lambda\right)_{x} & =\rho\omega.\label{eq:e1d:reaction}
\end{align}

\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 which is present explicitly in the equations.
 For this purpose, we use the equation derived in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 by specializing it to one dimension: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dM}{dt}=s,\label{eq:shock-change}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $M=-\rho_{\text{a}}D$
\end_inset

 is the normal mass flux into the shock, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\text{a}}$
\end_inset

 is the upstream density, and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
s & =\frac{1}{A_{0}}\left(R_{\text{s}}-A_{\text{s}}\right), & A_{0} & =\frac{2}{\gamma+1}Mv_{\text{a}}\left(3+\frac{\gamma p_{\text{a}}\rho_{\text{a}}}{M^{2}}\right),\label{eq:s-A0}\\
R_{\text{s}} & =Q(\gamma-1)\rho_{\text{s}}\omega_{\text{s}}, & A_{\text{s}} & =\rho_{\text{s}}(c_{\text{s}}^{2}-U_{\text{s}}^{2})u_{x}|_{\text{s}},\label{eq:Rs-As}
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c=\sqrt{\gamma p/\rho}$

 except for the velocity gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{x}|_{\text{s}}$
\end_inset

 at the shock, which must be determined numerically by solving for the flow
 downstream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Rankineâ€“Hugoniot conditions at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

 give all the state variables in terms of the mass flux (or, equivalently,
 the shock speed): 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
p_{\text{s}} & =-\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1}p_{\text{a}}+\frac{2v_{\text{a}}M^{2}}{\gamma+1}, & v_{\text{s}} & =\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1}v_{\text{a}}+\frac{2}{\gamma+1}\frac{\gamma p_{\text{a}}}{M^{2}}, & U_{\text{s}} & =\frac{M}{\rhoS}, & \lambdaS=0, &  & \rho_{\text{s}}=\frac{1}{v_{\text{s}}}.\label{RH-conditions}
\end{align}

\begin_layout Standard
Ambient state ahead of the shock is given by density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoA$
\end_inset

, pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $\pA$
\end_inset

, and velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\uA=0$
\end_inset

, hence, the flow ahead of the shock is motionless.
 Additionally, we assume that the reaction rate 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=0$
\end_inset

 in the ambient state such that the reaction is initiated by the leading
 shock wave.
\end_layout

All equations are nondimensionalized using upstream scales, also called
 Erpenbeck scales, namely, density scale is 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{\text{a}}$
\end_inset

, pressure scale is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\text{a}}$
\end_inset

, velocity scale is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{p_{\text{a}}/\rho_{\text{a}}}$
\end_inset

, energy scale is 
\begin_inset Formula $RT_{\text{a}}$
\end_inset

, length scale is the length of the steady-state half-reaction zone, and
 the characteristic time scale is the length scale divided by the velocity
 scale.
 In these scales equations retain their form.

) is the ZND solution that travels to the right with constant speed 
\begin_inset Formula $\DZnd$
\end_inset

, which reduces to the algebraic-differential problem:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}

, which are constant in the steady-state wave through the reaction zone,
 the ZND solution is given then by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\bar{v}=\frac{\gamma}{\gamma+1}\frac{\bar{P}}{\bar{M}^{2}}(1-\delta),\quad\bar{p}=\bar{P}-\bar{M}^{2}\bar{v},\quad\bar{U}=\bar{M}\bar{v},\label{eq:steady-state}

Simulation proceeds to the final time 
\begin_inset Formula $\TFinal$

 While computing the solution, we record the time series of the perturbation
 of detonation velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi'(t)$
\end_inset

 at uniform time intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $\DeltaT=0.005$
\end_inset

.
 When simulation reaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\TFinal$
\end_inset

, the solver computes the ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-norms of the time series for 
\begin_inset Formula $\TFinal/2\leq t\leq\TFinal$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq t\leq\TFinal/2$
\end_inset

, and if this ratio is smaller than three, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\TFinal$
\end_inset

 is increased to 100, as we found it necessary to record longer time series
 when the flow is not sufficiently unstable.
 The analysis of the resulting time series of the perturbation of detonation
 velocity allows us to extract growth rates and frequencies of unstable
 modes by a postprocessing method described below in Subsection

We also need to provide initial conditions for

 First, the perturbation of the detonation velocity by a small value 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

=
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-10}$
\end_inset

 is specified.
 Then, the initial value of 
\begin_inset Formula $M'$
\end_inset

 is computed using 
\begin_inset Formula $M'=-\rhoA A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The Rankineâ€“Hugoniot conditions are then used to find 
\begin_inset Formula $\rhoS'$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\uS'$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pS'$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $M'$
\end_inset

.
 Subsequently, initial conditions for perturbations over the whole grid
 are computed using 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\rho'_{0}(x)=\frac{\rhoS'}{\rhoSZnd}\rhoZnd(x),\quad u'_{0}(x)=\frac{\uS'}{\uSZnd}\uZnd(x),\quad p'_{0}(x)=\frac{\pS'}{\pSZnd}\pZnd(x),\quad\lambda'_{0}(x)=A_{0}\lambdaZnd(x).\label{eq:algorithm:ic}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

As can be seen from these formulas, the initial conditions for perturbations
 are specified as a multiple of the ZND solution.
 We found that such an initial condition minimizes the transient behavior
 in the time series of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi'$
\end_inset

 at early times.
 The beginning of the time series is cut off before the post-processing
 in order to eliminate the initial numerical transients from the signal.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
To process such a time series, an efficient and robust algorithm is required
 such that the stability spectrum is computed as accurately as possible.
 At the heart of our postprocessing algorithm is the dynamic mode decomposition
 (DMD), which was developed in recent years in the fluid-dynamics community
 for analysis of the flows in numerical simulations and physical experiments.
 The DMD is a powerful method that is able to extract spectral information
 from complex data coming from different fluid-dynamic systems.
 It was introduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "SchmidSesterhenn2008,RowleyEtAl2009,Schmid2010"

.
 The basic introduction to DMD as well as several examples of its use in
 different fields can be found in the book by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "KutzEtAl2016Book"

\end_inset

.
 In contrast with other methods for extraction of low-dimensional information
 from high-dimensional data, DMD modes, although not orthogonal like, for
 example, modes in proper orthogonal decomposition

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

, carry information about a single frequency, similar to normal modes.
 One of the important features of the method is that although DMD was developed
 and used originally by fluid dynamicists, the method is data-driven and
 is not coupled to the equations governing fluid flows.
 As such, it finds applications in many other fields besides fluid mechanics
 and can be used in an equation-free manner.
 Modern applications of these method include numerous fields that rely heavily
 on data analysis such as atmospheric research

 of normal modes of linear systems and, hence, is similar to DMD spectrum.

The remainder of this section proceeds as follows.
 First, for completeness, we present a brief generic description of the

Description of the DMD algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that we have a time series of the snapshots of the state of some
 dynamical system: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x=[x_{0},\dots,x_{n}]^{\T},\label{eq:algorithm:postproc:given-time-series}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\in\R^{m}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i=0,\dots,n$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 being a snapshot of the system state.
 Assume also that snapshots are taken at uniform time intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $\DeltaT$
\end_inset

.
 Our purpose is to find an eigendecomposition of a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{k}=Ax_{k-1}
\]

\end_inset

for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,\dots,n$
\end_inset

 at least in the least-squares sense.
 The eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 contain the information on the growth/decay rates and frequencies of oscillatio
ns that, when combined, represent the time evolution of the dynamical system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To proceed, we define matrices 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X=[x_{0},\dots,x_{n-1}]^{\T},\quad Y=[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]^{\T}\label{eq:algorithm:postproc:input-matrices}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

such that 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=AX$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $A=YX^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 is a Mooreâ€“Penrose pseudoinverse of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 Although the problem is formally solved now, we cannot just do the eigendecompo
sition of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\R^{m\times m}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 generally being large.
 Instead, a low-rank approximation matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}$
\end_inset

 and its eigendecomposition are found.

 Truncation is necessary, for example, because all singular values

Application of DMD to the time series of detonation velocity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DMD as it was introduced in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Schmid2010"

\end_inset

 assumes that each snapshot in a time series is a high-dimensional vector
 coming, for example, from a solution variable on a numerical grid at a
 given time step in simulations or from a large number of flow sensors in
 experiments.
 The time series of perturbation of detonation velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi'$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:algorithm:postproc:time-series"

\end_inset

 that we record during our simulations are one-dimensional, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi'_{k}\in\R$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0,\dots,n$
\end_inset

.
 As pointed out in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "pp. 401--402"
key "TuEtAl2014"

\end_inset

, one-dimensional time series yields the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}$
\end_inset

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times1$
\end_inset

, therefore it has only one real eigenvalue, which can only capture an exponenti
al growth or decay, but not oscillations.
 To overcome this rank-deficiency problem, we build an input Hankel matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Z=\begin{bmatrix}\psi'_{0} & \cdots & \psi'_{n-L}\\
\psi'_{1} & \cdots & \psi'_{n-L+1}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
\psi'_{L-1} & \cdots & \psi'_{n}
\end{bmatrix},\label{eq:algorithm:postproc:input-hankel-matrix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

which stacks time-shifted values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi'$
\end_inset

.
 This approach is commonly used in other methods of time-series analysis
 such as Singular Spectral Analysis (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
 Number 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 defines the upper bound on the number of modes that we can extract from
 the time series.
 In this work, 
\begin_inset Formula $L=1000$
\end_inset

 is used.
 Then, the input matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\begin_inset Formula $Z$

 by excluding the last and first columns of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

, respectively.

\begin_layout Standard
As time series of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi'$
\end_inset

 inevitably contains noise induced by truncation and rounding errors of
 the numerical computations, truncation of matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $U,$

\begin_inset Formula $V$

\end_inset

 with a target rank 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 will yield a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}\in\R^{r\times r}$
\end_inset

 whose eigenvalues are all physical only if 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is known 
\emph on
a priori
\emph default
.
 However, if the rank choice is done by a machine, there is always a possibility
 that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 will be larger than the rank of the ideal low-rank approximation, hence,
 the spurious eigenvalues will be present in the output of DMD (with even
 more severe consequences if, for example, instead of a complex-conjugate
 pair of eigenvalues only one real eigenvalue would be found).
 As we aim to apply DMD in Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:e1d:results"

\end_inset

 for parametric studies of detonation stability, an algorithm is needed
 for choosing the target rank 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 automatically and as accurately as possible.
 The details of the algorithm that we use are provided below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the beginning of the time series 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:algorithm:postproc:time-series"

\end_inset

 must be cut off as it is necessary to exclude determining DMD modes from
 nonmodal behavior occurring due to the relaxation of the perturbation solution
 from volatile initial conditions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:algorithm:ic"

\end_inset

 to a superposition of modes.
 This cutoff time depends on the length of the time series.
 Our simulations run by default to final time 
\begin_inset Formula $\TFinal=10$
\end_inset

, however they can be prolonged as described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:linearized-system"

\end_inset

.
 If the final time of the time series is larger than 10, then the cutoff
 time is 10, otherwise it is 1.
 Then, the input matrix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:algorithm:postproc:input-hankel-matrix"

\end_inset

 is built and separated into 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 After that, candidates for a possible rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 are determined by the following procedure.
 We consider all singular values 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,\dots,K$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 normalized by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 being the smallest index corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{K+1}<10^{-10}$
\end_inset

.
 Then if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k+1}/\sigma_{k}<0.95$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is added to the list of possible ranks as there is a sufficient gap between
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k+1}$
\end_inset

, which indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 is a spurious singular value.
 For each rank from the list of all possible ranks we determine DMD decompositio
n and compute the fit and residual errors 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:algorithm:postproc:errors"

\end_inset

.
 Then we consider two smallest fit errors 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\text{DMD},1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\text{DMD},2}$
\end_inset

, and if 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\leq e_{\text{DMD},1}/e_{\text{DMD},2}\leq1$
\end_inset

, then we also take into account corresponding residual errors, so that
 the DMD decomposition corresponding to the smallest residual error is considere
d the best.
 Otherwise, the best one corresponds to the decomposition with the fit error
 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\text{DMD},1}$
\end_inset

.
 Once the best-rank DMD is determined, its eigenvalues that have the real
 part larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 and positive imaginary part are saved as an output of the postprocessing
 algorithm sorted by the frequency and real part, so that the enumeration
 of modes is the same as in the normal-mode analysis.

 The added noise is to mimic the noise due to numerical simulation errors.

To assess the performance of the postprocessing algorithm, we measure relative

 We find that in general

These examples demonstrate that the postprocessing algorithm we use is able
 to extract stability spectra from time series consisting of several modes
 of very different growth rates and frequencies.
 That said, it must be clear that there are also limitations to the procedure:
 the quality of the extracted spectrum in general depends on the quality
 of the time series at hand (its sampling rate, length, noise level, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the Fourier transform and power spectra are frequently used in analysis
 of oscillatory dynamics, here we contrast this traditional method with
 the present approach.
 Applying the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the time series, one can determine
 approximate values of frequencies of the modes via the power spectrum and
 then use nonlinear least-squares solver to find growth rates of the modes.
 However note that for exponentially growing or decaying oscillations, FFT
 analysis may be too inaccurate.
 To illustrate, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the time series 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 and its power spectra generated via FFT and DMD.
 While the DMD spectrum is sparse and is in excellent agreement with the
 time series, the FFT spectrum is seen to be essentially flat and dense
 in the sense that it is hard to find the particular modes present in the
 time series.

The algorithm for extracting growth rates and frequencies of unstable modes
 presented in this section requires multiple application of DMD to find
 the best low-rank approximation.
 However, the most expensive operation in the algorithm (SVD of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

) is carried out only once.
 Our postprocessing code is based on the Intel Math Kernel Library, which
 contains optimized routines for numerical linear algebra.
 The time that it takes to postprocess our data varies as it is a function
 of the length of the time series and the number of possible ranks.
 The typical time on a workstation with a Xeon processor is on the order
 of a minute.
 Besides, as we process only one-dimensional time series 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:algorithm:postproc:time-series"

, without having to save the full solution on the numerical grid for each

 Generally, increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 has the effect of making the solution more unstable.
 The role of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is more complicated.
 For example, both very large and very small 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 correspond to stable detonations while there is an instability at intermediate
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $E$

The steady-state traveling-wave solutions of (

-
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) are found by setting the time derivatives in the system to zero.
 In figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we show such ZND solution profiles computed with fixed parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1.2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E=30$
\end_inset

, and for 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=\{0.5,1,10,50,100\}$
\end_inset

.
 For this particular value of 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

, the case 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=50$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a strongly unstable solution, while all other values of
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 correspond to stable or weakly unstable solutions.
 As can be seen from the steady-state profiles, the strongly unstable case
 occurs for the ZND solution approaching a square-wave shape with a spiky
 heat-release zone, while all the other cases correspond to relatively smooth
 profiles.
 This effect of the steady-state solutions on their stability is well known.
 The limiting case of a true square-wave detonation with instantaneous heat
 release is known to possess a pathological spectrum with infinite number
 of unstable eigenvalues with growth rates increasing unboundedly with the
 mode number (or its frequency).
 In other words, the square-wave stability problem is ill-posed.
 However, with a finite-rate chemistry, the problem remains well-posed even
 though the sharper the heat-release rate the larger the number of unstable
 modes and the larger their growth rates and frequencies.
 Computing the latter situations becomes a challenging problem.

 As other researchers provide explicit values for unstable spectra for parameter

 These researchers all used different scales, which are converted here to
 the same scales for comparison.
 We choose to convert to the Erpenbeck scales used in the present work.
 The conversion factors are as follows.
 Conversion factor from the scales of

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we have introduced a novel method for linear stability
 analysis of detonation waves and applied it to the detonation model based
 on the reactive Euler equations with one-step chemistry.
 The method consists of two parts.
 First is a numerical solution of the time-dependent system linearized about
 base ZND solution by a shock-fitting numerical algorithm of high order
 of accuracy.
 The result of such numerical calculation is a time series of the perturbation
 of detonation velocity for the linear problem.
 This solution is obtained only over relatively short time intervals which
 is computationally inexpensive.
 The second part of the method is an analysis of the obtained time series
 by using dynamic mode decomposition.
 As a result, we are able to calculate detailed stability properties of
 the model and compare our results to the normal-mode results obtaining
 excellent agreement, thus, validating the correctness of the method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being confident in the validity of the method, we extend the knowledge about
 the linear stability properties of the model by computing neutral stability
 boundaries for several values of specific-heats ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and determined that the neutral stability boundary for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1.1$
\end_inset

 is determined by the composition of the first two modes, while for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=\{1.2,1.3,1.4\}$
\end_inset

 it is determined only by the fundamental mode.
