The picture that is emerging is that although all propagating detonations are unstable, there is a wide range of behavior with one extreme being nearly laminar but unsteady periodic flow and the other chaotic instability with highly turbulent flow. We discuss the implications of this for detonation propagation and dynamic behavior such as diffraction, initiation, and quenching or failure. },
