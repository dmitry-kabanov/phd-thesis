The English could use some polish; e.g.: English has these things
known as articles.

I suggest you fix this in introduction or conclusion subsections,
and do not worry to much in the very technical parts.

Below (2.39) in page 42

 "We found that a simple evaluation of $L$ was not enough to
  guarantee numerical stability of simulations, hence the use
  of the LaxÐFriedrichs flux in (2.38)."

A bit more explanation would be useful. Why does (2.38) fix the
problem? What was the problem?
Otherwise it sounds a bit too much like cook-book.

 "We found that such an initial condition minimizes the transient
  behavior in the time series of $\psi^\prime$ at early times."

Do you know why? If so, say it.

 Item 2
 "Truncation is necessary, for example, because all singular
 values $\sigma_i$ in $\Sigma$ with $i > r$ are due to the noise
 in matrix $X$."

I think that you mean to say:
 Truncation is necessary, for example, if all the singular
 values $\sigma_i$ in $\Sigma$ with $i > r$ are due to noise
 in the matrix $X$.

A related question: but how do you find $r$?
 At the very least you should say here "later on we will
 explain how we determine $r$."

... which you do 3 pages later [in page 50]

Page 50, third line from the top and below:

 "with even more severe consequences if, for example, instead
  of a complex-conjugate pair of eigenvalues only one real
  eigenvalue would be found"

This is poorly explained. I have no idea of what you are talking
about. Do not try to put everything into a single sentence. Split
and then explain a little better.

Page 50, middle of the page

 "If the final time of the time series is larger than 10, then
  the cutoff time is 10, otherwise it is 1."

Please, explain why this. There must be a reason for this, what
is it? Even when you do trial and error, there is a reason for
the final pick.

This keeps happening! You throw threshold numbers without any
explanation at all. These thresholds are crucial elements in the
computation. If they are arbitrary [which I assume they are not],
then the credibility of the final answer is nil. Hence it is rather
important that you give some argument to justify their choice.
A little below you argue that

  $\sigma_{k+1}/\sigma_k < 0.95$ provides a sufficient
  gap between eigenvalues to indicate $\sigma_{k+1}$ is spurious.

To me it sounds like 0.95 is pretty close to one. Why is this a
large gap? If you are looking at continuum spectrum, and you have
good resolution, a gap like this could be significant. But if it
is discrete, why?

Bottom of page
  "eigenvalues that have the real part larger than $-1$ and
   positive imaginary part are saved ..."

I understand why only positive imaginary part [they come in
complex conjugate pairs], but why real part > -1? For instability
> 0 is what you need. So, ok, you want to see a bit of what is
hiding on the other side of the imaginary axis. But why -1 and
not -10, or -pi ... what makes "-1" your choice?

Page 51, above (2.50)

   "... such that the noise is proportional to the signal:"

Is this realistic? In a numerical computation I would expect that
the "noise" is controlled by two things: round-off and truncation.

Here you are assuming that it is all truncation. This is perhaps
correct, as round-off would become significant closer to the
machine precision. What are you using?  16 digits?
Adding a statement saying that you expect the errors to be
controlled by truncation, and not round off, might be useful.

Page 53, bottom:

   "Besides, as we process only one-dimensional time series
   (2.41), without having to save the full solution on the
   numerical grid for each time step, there is a substantial
   saving in terms of disk space and corresponding input-output
   operations."

This is a good place for a question I have been meaning to ask:

 Is there any advantage in storing a very long time series for
 just one variable, as opposed to storing many variables, but
 for a shorter time period?

 The second would make the needed numerical solve shorter. Thus,
 in principle, you could do it more accurately and reduce noise.

 I think that you should explain why you decided to keep just
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 one time series, while in fact the method, as presented in (2.42)
 page 46 and forward, assumes that you keep quite a bit more.

Page 56, below table

 "In addition, the fundamental mode for the second case is
  purely exponential and has two branches."

What do you mean "two branches"? That the eigenvalue corresponds
to a two dimensional eigenspace?
Or that there are two different but very close eigenvalues?
[I think it is the second, but you should explain].
